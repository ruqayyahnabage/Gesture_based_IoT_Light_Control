This project combines electronics and machine learning to create a smart light control system. A neural network recognizes hand gestures, allowing you to turn lights on, off, or dim themâ€”completely touch-free. Built using an Arduino circuit board and LEDs, it showcases how gesture recognition can be integrated into everyday IoT applications.

The 3 files Main_Sketch.ino, data.h and NN_functions.h are the files for the first (indoor/main Arduino) and the file Sender_light_intensity.ino is for the second (outdoor) Arduino.
